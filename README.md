# p-IQSC-protocol
purified Integrated Quantum Sensing and Communication using DEJMPS protocol
Exploratory Project under Prof. Atul Kumar

• Implemented a novel P-IQSC architecture that integrates DEJMPS based entanglement purification.

• Gave analytical and simulation-based evidence demonstrating significant improvements in secrecy capacity and detection probability compared to conventional IQSC systems without purification
